founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39

as the permanent president reflected the Congress&#39;s rejection
of Prussia&#39;s rising influence. Disagreement within restoration
politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed
by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman
Klemens von Metternich.[51][52] The Zollverein, a tariff
union, furthered economic unity.[53] In light of revolutionary
movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started
the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the
German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was
offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he
rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary
setback for the movement.[54]

The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[13] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land (&#39;the German lands&#39;), is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), which descended from Old High German *diutisc &#39;of the people&#39; (from diot or diota &#39;people&#39;), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants.
